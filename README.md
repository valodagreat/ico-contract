# ICO CONTRACT

This project is the smart contract of my ICO, where owners of CryptoDevNFT can claim their tokens and users can buy the token before public launch to be a part of the project. This project was built with hardhat.

You can check out the project [here](https://ico-frontend-new.vercel.app/)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat help
```
